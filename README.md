# üê¢ Pi Camp Turtle Race

An engaging Python programming project that creates an animated turtle racing game using Python's built-in turtle graphics library. This project is designed for students learning Python programming fundamentals while having fun with visual graphics.

## üìã Project Overview

The Turtle Race project teaches students essential Python programming concepts through the creation of an interactive racing game. Multiple colorful turtles compete in a race across the screen, with random movement creating unpredictable and exciting outcomes.

## üéØ Learning Objectives

This project helps students master:
- **Python Basics**: Variables, loops, functions, and conditionals
- **Turtle Graphics**: Drawing, movement, and animation concepts
- **Random Number Generation**: Creating unpredictable game elements
- **Object-Oriented Programming**: Working with turtle instances
- **Game Logic**: Winner determination and game flow control
- **Code Organization**: Structuring programs with functions

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Libraries

- **Python 3.x**: Core programming language
- **Turtle Graphics**: Built-in Python graphics library
- **Random Module**: For generating unpredictable movement
- **Standard Library**: No external dependencies required

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher installed on your system
- Basic understanding of Python syntax (variables, loops, functions)

### Quick Start

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/The-Pi-Academy/turtle-race.git
   cd turtle-race
   ```

2. **Run the Simple Version** (Recommended for beginners)
   ```bash
   python simple.py
   ```

3. **Run the Advanced Version**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

4. **Start with the Template** (For learning)
   ```bash
   python template.py
   ```

### No Installation Required!
All required libraries (`turtle`, `random`) are included with Python by default.

## üéÆ How to Play

1. **Start the Program**: Run any of the Python files
2. **Watch the Race**: Turtles will automatically begin racing
3. **Observe the Winner**: The winning turtle will perform a celebration spin
4. **Exit**: Press Enter when prompted to close the program

## üé® Code Breakdown

### Key Components

**Race Track Creation**
```python
# Creates numbered lanes and dashed finish lines
for step in range(20):
    turtle.write(step + 1, align='center')
    # Draws dashed lines for visual appeal
```

**Dynamic Turtle Generation**
```python
def create_turtle(color, start):
    instance = turtle.Turtle()
    instance.color(color)
    instance.shape('turtle')
    # Positions turtle at starting line
```

**Random Movement Logic**
```python
for turn in range(50):
    for p in players:
        p.forward(random.randint(1, 15))  # Random speed!
```

**Winner Detection**
```python
# Finds the turtle that traveled the farthest
max_position = 0
winner = None
for turtle in players:
    if turtle.pos()[0] > max_position:
        winner = turtle
```

## üéì Educational Extensions

### Beginner Modifications
- Change turtle colors or add new ones
- Adjust racing speed ranges
- Modify the number of race rounds
- Add turtle names or numbers

### Intermediate Challenges
- Add a betting system where users pick winners
- Create multiple race tracks
- Implement different turtle speeds based on color
- Add sound effects (using `pygame` or `playsound`)

### Advanced Features
- User input for turtle selection
- Score tracking across multiple races
- Graphical user interface with buttons
- Save race results to a file
- Create tournament brackets

## üîß Customization Options

### Turtle Colors
The project includes these colors by default:
```python
colors = ['blue', 'green', 'khaki', 'maroon', 'orange', 
          'peru', 'pink', 'purple', 'red', 'salmon', 'yellow']
```

### Speed Settings
- **Race Rounds**: Modify the `range(50)` in the main race loop
- **Movement Speed**: Adjust `random.randint(1, 15)` values
- **Animation Speed**: Change `turtle.speed(10)` for faster/slower drawing

### Track Layout
- **Track Length**: Modify starting positions and track dimensions
- **Number of Lanes**: Adjust `players_step` and starting positions
- **Visual Elements**: Customize the dashed lines and numbering

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Module not found" error**
- Ensure you're using Python 3.x
- Turtle is built-in; no installation needed

**Turtles not moving**
- Check that the race loop is properly indented
- Verify random module import

**Graphics window closes immediately**
- Make sure `input('press enter to quit')` is at the end
- Don't close the graphics window manually during execution

**Slow performance**
- Reduce the number of turtles
- Decrease turtle.speed() value
- Simplify the track drawing
